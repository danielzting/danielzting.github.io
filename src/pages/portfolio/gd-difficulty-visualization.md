This is the companion visualization to my blog post about the [little-known skill ceiling of Geometry Dash](/blog/the-little-known-skill-ceiling-of-geometry-dash). [Check it out here.](https://danielzting.github.io/gd-difficulty-visualization/)

This project is special in that it is the first created using AI. In fact, I tried to entirely "vibe code" from start to finish to get some experience with AI and see for myself whether AI can take my job. This project was a good candidate for vibe coding for a couple of reasons:

1. I kind of wanted to get it and the blog post out the door, having spent at least a dozen hours of research on it over several weeks.
2. I already knew the tech stack (a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript static site built on Vite) fairly well, with the exception of D3, which I wasn't that interested in learning.
3. It is a fairly simple project and I will probably never touch it again after this.

I made it a point to handcraft this website and the code that I care about the most since I like to learn technologies hands-on, but this project was made almost completely by prompting the free tier of GitHub Copilot in VSCode. My impressions were pretty positive; GPT-5 mini was able to translate some pretty complex queries into working code against my doubts many times, and the times it failed I was able to get it working with some additional prompting or manual edits. Still, I don't think AI will be completely replacing software engineers anytime in the near future for unrelated reasons. That could be copium but that's a topic for another day.
