## Interests

### Computer science and technology

Unlike many people who only program for the money, I am passionate about programming and enjoy learning new technologies (and making money). I am also interested in the hardware side of things and keep up with cool releases in consumer tech to some extent. Though I haven't actually finished a significant project in years, you can find my work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/danielzting).

### Powerlifting and sports

This is currently my biggest hobby, which I'm a little reluctant to admit, since I say I train for strength over aesthetics but currently have neither 😆 I never liked any sports growing up besides maybe table tennis, so if you told my past 140lbs completely unathletic self that I would become a gym bro I would have not believed you. Even though I'm barely a beginner in this sport, I'm proud of how much I've come so far. You can view my competition PRs at [OpenPowerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/danielting1).

Other sports I enjoy are table tennis, biking, and running. I don't do these consistently and would not be able to hold a conversation about them, but they're still fun.

### Gaming

I would consider myself fairly skilled at Geometry Dash—nowhere near top players, but I have beaten two extreme demons (Acu and Cataclysm) and have 75% on Bloodbath. I don't play any other games seriously, but I do play Minecraft as a medium of hanging out, and some story-driven singleplayer games. You can find me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/unixrubix).

### Music and literature

I may be a STEM major but I do appreciate the creative arts too. Music is a big part of my life in that I have a decent number of years of experience playing piano, and I like going to concerts. My most listened-to genres are EDM, Christian, and classical, but I will listen to anything. If you have any music recommendations, let me know! You can find me on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/profile/danielzting).

I love a good book too, though I don't read nearly as much as I should these days. My favorite non-fiction book is *Gödel, Escher, Bach* and my favorite fiction series is the *Three Body Problem* trilogy. I'm a huge sucker for sci-fi.

### Twisty puzzles

In middle school I got into speedcubing and was averaging 15 seconds at my best. I don't practice anymore but can still solve a 2×2 to 5×5, Pyraminx, Megaminx, and 3×3 blindfolded. I went to two World Cube Association competitions including the 2017 World Championships in Paris, which you can find on the [WCA website](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017TING02).
