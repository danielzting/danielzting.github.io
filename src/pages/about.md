You found my personal homepage!

## Interests

### Computer science and technology

I like to build projects and learn new technologies in my free time. I am also interested in the hardware side of things and keep up with releases in consumer tech to some extent. You can find my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielzting).

### Powerlifting and sports

My biggest passion is repeatedly picking up heavy circles. I'm no pro by any means but I am proud of how far I've come considering I grew up completely unathletic. You can find me on [OpenPowerlifting](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/danielting1).

Other sports I enjoy are table tennis, biking, and running. I don't do these consistently and would not be able to hold a conversation about them, but they're still fun.

### Gaming

The only game I can say I am somewhat good at is Geometry Dash. I don't play any other games seriously, but I do play Minecraft as a medium of hanging out, some story-driven singleplayer games, and the occasional friendslop when my friends force me to buy another one. Of course I like to play IRL games too. You can find me on [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/unixrubix).

### Music and literature

I may be a STEM major but I do appreciate the creative arts too. Music is a big part of my life in that I like to play piano and go to concerts. My most listened-to genres are electronic, Christian, and classical, but I will listen to anything. If you have any music recommendations, let me know! You can find me on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/profile/danielzting).

I love a good book too, though I don't read nearly as much as I should these days. My favorite non-fiction book is *Gödel, Escher, Bach* and my favorite fiction series is the *Three Body Problem* trilogy. I'm a huge sucker for sci-fi.

### Twisty puzzles

I got into speedcubing in middle school. I stopped practicing seriously but can still solve a 2×2 to 5×5, Pyraminx, Megaminx, and 3×3 blindfolded. I went to two World Cube Association competitions, which you can find on the [WCA website](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2017TING02). Even though I don't speedcube anymore, the favicon for this site is still a Rubik's Cube in ASCII art. I like it because it's a small symbol of my inner nerd.
